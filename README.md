Exports a **referentially intact subset** of a MySQL database.

Note: although this tool targets MySQL only for now, it is designed to be able to support other RDBMS in the future.

## Introduction

Did you ever need to export just a couple tables from your MySQL database, but end up with broken foreign key constraints?
What if you could import every single foreign row your data depends on as well, and nothing more?
This tool does just that.

Let's say you want to dump just the `order_items` table below:

If you use `mysqldump`, you'll get broken foreign key constraints to `orders` and `products`.

If you use `smartdump` instead, you'll get the whole `order_items` table, **plus** the rows from `orders` and `products` required to satisfy the constraints, **plus**, in turn, the rows from `users` and `countries` required to satisfy the remaining constraints! ðŸ’ª

The key takeaway here is that **`smartdump` will only import the rows required to satisfy the constraints**.

## Usage

To be written.

## Future scope (todo)

- support for other RDBMS
- support for loading only *n* rows in the base tables; useful to extract a sample dataset
- support for loading *incoming* relationships to the tables (**?**)  
  Right now, only the outgoing relationships are followed, it could be interesting to follow incoming relationships to each row we're exporting as well; at least as an option?
