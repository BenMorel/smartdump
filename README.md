## Introduction

Did you ever need to download just a couple tables from your MySQL database, together with all their relationships?
This tool does just that.

Let's say you want to dump just the `order_items` table below:

If you use `mysqldump`, you'll get broken foreign key constraints to `orders` and `products`.

If you use `smartdump` instead, you'll get the whole `order_items` table, **plus** the rows from `orders` and `products` required to satisfy the constraints, **plus**, in turn, the rows from `users` and `countries` required to satisfy the remaining constraints! ðŸ’ª
